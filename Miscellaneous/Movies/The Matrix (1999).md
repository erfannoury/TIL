# The Matrix (1999)

## Facts
* Neo has a white version of a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic keyboard. I have a black one :smiley:
* At the beginning of the movie, Trinity is at a hotel in room number 303, as her name implies, obviously.
* Neo's room number is 101, as he is the _**One**_. At about the end of the movie, when he is left out in the Matrix and first tries to fight _Agent Smith_ but then runs away, the phone is ringing in room number 303; in fact the same room that Trinity was at.
