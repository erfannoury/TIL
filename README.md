# Today I Learned

This repo is inspired by [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).

"We are constantly learning new things. This is a repo to share our learnings. TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining a new concept, bit of syntax, command, or tip that we've learned."
