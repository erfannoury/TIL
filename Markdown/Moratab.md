[Moratab](http://www.sobhe.ir/moratab/) is a great Markdown editor for Persian text from [Sobhe](http://sobhe.ir). It is an open source project ([sobhe/moratab](https://github.com/sobhe/moratab)) and based on StackEdit. Great thing about this project is that you can simply run it locally if you have Python installed. To run *Moratab* using Python 2.x, you can use these commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:sobhe/moratab.git
cd moratab/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
