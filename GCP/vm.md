After depolying a Deep Learning VM, Anaconda Python should be installed separately. After installing the Anaconda Python install optimized binaries of libraries like TensorFlow from `/opt/deeplearning/binaries/*` using the following command:

```
$ pip install /opt/deeplearning/binaries/tensorflow/tensorflow-gpu*.whl
```
