If the hard-drive that you are planning to install Windows on is partitioned with GPT, then you are in trouble. When installing from the usual media for Windows, you will hit errors when selecting a partition to install Windows on. 

The solution is to create a bootable USB drive and format it with GPT using **_Rufus_** program. Then you are good to go :)

Happy Do-ing with Windows :smiley:
