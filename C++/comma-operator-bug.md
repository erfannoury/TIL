After coding for a long time in MATLAB/Python or other similar languages in which for indexing a multi-dimensional array or matrix, you would use a comma-separated list of indices, you might be prone to a serious bug when coding in C/C++ or languages syntactically based on C, while trying to index multi-dimensional arrays or arrays of pointers to arrays. 
Consider for example you have an array of pointers to arrays named `mat`. Normally you would index it like `mat[i][j]`, but you might instead write `mat[i,j]`. This will cause a serious bug which can't be found and detected easily. Syntactically, this statement is correct; you are using the _comma operator_. When using the comma operator, the first statement before the comma character will be evaluated, then the statement after the comma will be executed and at last, the result of the second statement will be returned. So when you write `mat[i,j]`, it will be evaluated like `mat[j]` and thus you will get a pointer instead of a normal primitive data type. This gets even more serious when you have defined your matrix to be of square shape. In this case, you won't even get a segmentation fault when iterating over the elements of the matrix. So, look out for this bug and always try to avoid it. It wasted 2 precious hours of mine and a labmate yesterday.
